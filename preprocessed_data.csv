0,0,2,0,2.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,I have never conducted an actual research project in all of my college courses so I found this whole process very interesting and sometimes challenging. The most challenging part for me was coming up with a concern to research and investigate; everything else kind of fell into place after that for me.,4.0,2.0,I learned that my students are very dependent on the internet as a whole when it comes to their learning and I think in the long run it is something that sometimes can hinder them rather than help them so I want to make sure that technology is not dependent in my future classroom.,This study made me realize that as a teacher I think I am taking the right steps to make sure I have the most successful classroom and students.,I found that limiting certain technologies in the classroom can ultimately benefit the students in the long run.,0

It was extremely easy to find an issue in the classroom that I wanted to help the students improve on a certain skill.,3.0,2.0,I learned that my students really enjoyed one on one conversations with the teacher which the students really benefited from when improving their organizational skills. ,It made me think of all the things a teacher has to do on a daily basis to get through the day plus having to record data at the same time as teaching lessons to the students.,I found that students started to improve their organizational skills once the study started and they were aware of what was expected of them as students. I found that students really benefit when teachers take the time to have individual conversations with them because it makes them feel special and that the teacher really cares about them. ,1
0,0,1,0,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,The plus of this project is learning how to identify a problem within the classroom and then deciding different ways to address it. This will definitely help in the future when we are faced with different problems within the classroom.,5.0,4.0,"I learned that not all interventions will work for every student. It's all about trial and error and observing changes in behaviors, etc. ",I noticed that I am capable of collecting data and making changes within the classroom.

When you have a good relationship with your students and students feel comfortable within the classroom then you can eventually get that desired behavior that you have been working for.,5.0,4.0,"I learned that all three of my students are capable of exhibiting the desired behaviors of the classroom, especially if this process is implemented throughout the year.","This study helped me to realize that their will be behavior challenges within my classroom but we, as the teacher control how we react to them. Although it is easy to give off the same attitude that the students are giving off, the desired behavior is more likely to be attained if you take a step back to figure out where this behavior is starting and getting to know your students a little better.",The results that I found was that having a conversation with your behavior problem students for 2 min for ten days can increase desired behavior throughout the school year as long as it is continuously implemented. This builds the relationship of the student and teacher and helps the student realize that the teacher cares and wants what is best for the student. This will ultimately help the student become more comfortable in the classroom as well as with the teacher.,0

I don't know if the intervention will continue to work but I was very pleased with how it did for my project. It was sometimes hard to remember to grab the cubes when we went back in the classroom while the students were in other places and shouted out. ,4.0,3.0,I learned that the students in my class did not even realize their behavior of shouting out until they had a visual and could see when their behavior occurred. ,It gave me insight in ways to solve future problem in my classroom and helped me see that I might have to try a few different things before I find out what works. ,I was looking to see if blurt cubes would help reduce the number of shout outs in a 1st grade classroom. I saw really good results of my study and it definitely helped the behavior in my classroom. Some students were still struggling to remember to raise their hand but they were able to at least start to remember to raise their hand every once in a while. ,0

The instructor for this class was helpful and accessible. her feedback was prompt and easy to follow. She was available for meetings outside of class and was very clear with her instructions.   ,5.0,5.0,I learned that dysgraphia is a disability that in no way reflects a students intelligence. I learned that supports and writing tools may help a student with dysgraphia slightly but ultimately these students may need accommodations to complete writing assignments. I learned alot about the data collection process that teachers must go through to get supports for their students. ,Conducting this study showed me how research and awareness can impact my students success. Instructors should be prepared to show student data when requesting accommodations. I learned that data collection and action research is not difficult to gather with adequate planning and a clear objective. ,"I found that handwriting tools may not be as helpful as advertised for students who have dysgraphia. An unexpected outcome that occurred during my research process was my research will be used as data for an upcoming meeting regarding potential accommodations for the participant. I did not expect my action research project to benefit the participant after it was concluded. I feel that my research impacted the path of the participant and will make a difference in the success of this student in 3rd grade.

0,0,1,2,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,One challenge I found to be difficult was figuring out the best way to collect data and analyze it. Once I completed my research and collected all of the data I was happy to see that the incentive did work and more students completed their homework. ,4.0,3.0,During this study I learned that when giving the students an incentive they work harder because they receive something at the end. For many students I learned that it was just the joy and excitement of being able to select something from a treasure box. I was able to realize that the students also have a problem with being responsible for their own papers and keeping track of them. ,This allowed me to see what incentives can do for students. It also allowed me to realize how little of parent involvement we have in our class.,I intended to find an increase in homework completion in our classroom. I ended up using a treasure box incentive for students who completed their ELA homework. The incentive did work for our classroom and many students completed their homework. I was able to get all but one student to complete their homework with the treasure box incentive.,0

It allowed me to see the thorough process of research to accurately find what will work best in the classroom. I also like how we were able to choose a project specific to our class and students. ,4.0,4.0,"I have learned that my students enjoy discussing things verbally, but in a controlled environment. I have also learned that once they feel comfortable in one discussion, they may feel more open to discuss in whole-class settings. ",This study has impacted my perception as a teacher because it has shown me how to try different things with my students to see what will work. It has also shown me how to stop complaining about what's wrong and attempt to fix it. ,"I found out that fishbowl discussions help improve engagement in an eighth grade English Language Arts classroom.

This strategy was effective. ,"Prior to my study, I did not see myself as a researcher. Now I know I can be both a teacher and researcher, and they go hand in hand. Research will help me better understand and teach my students. ",I intended to see students' transition times to decline (take less time to transition). This is the result that my data portrayed. ,1

The study was done is a very short time frame, which two of the three weeks were not full weeks for students, and they had spring break in the middle. I think this hindered a true result of the study.  ",0

It was interesting to watch the behavioral changes over the short period of the study. It was challenging to try to work one extra thing into an already packed schedule. Residency, residency assignments, and life already felt so heavy, to put a formal research project on the plate was stressful. Overall, the process was alright and I think in a more casual scale, all teachers do research like this frequently. ",4.0,3.0,I learned that tangram puzzles can be a useful tool to assist students in building their executive functioning skills. ,I think it impacted my perception of myself as a teacher by showing me that research is an important tool even if it is in an informal way. ,The outcomes I found as a result of my study was that kindergarten teachers can use tools to assist their students in gaining skills. I intended to find outcomes similar to what I found in that I expected students to be able to complete more tasks independently. One outcome that emerged unexpectedly was that I noticed some improvement in other cognitive abilities in the students. ,1

The challenge that I found in this process is the limitations from absences, and inconsistent student behavior. An interview element was that the action I chose benefited some students more than others.",5.0,3.0,I learned that implementing an intervention allows you to learn what may or may work for certain students. It helped me learn more about the students personalities more as well.,It impacted me as a teacher by giving me practice with possible interventions. I also learned that if you start the process it’s easier to see what you can do better or change if students aren’t benefiting. ,"As I mentioned before, my intervention seemed to benefit some students more than others. That’s okay because I can see that it wouldn’t be so hard to find the intervention that would help each student.",1

It was very mice to see a problem my mentor and I were facing be solved with my research. I enjoyed being able to find ways to fix challenges going on in the classroom. ,4.0,3.0,"In regards to my students, I learned that they do have a desire for learning/completing their homework, they just need support with finding motivational strategies. I also learned how different motivators impact my students and their learning. I want to be able to incorporate external motivation in my classroom that can lead to my students finding motivators that work for them. ",I think this study has impacted my perception of myself as a teacher because I know feel like I am able to solve my own classroom problems or find solutions to persisting challenges. I have a stronger confidence in my teaching ability and problem solving skills after doing this study. ,The outcomes found as a result of the study is the self monitoring charts have a positive impact on students motivation.

This was expected, and there were not any outcomes that came as a surprise and this was my only intended outcome for this research project.",0

I really enjoyed designing my project from scratch.",2.0,4.0,My students do want to help one another and collaborate but can often get caught up in themselves and forget about those around them. They are also natural communicators and are comfortable expressing themselves.,"By conducting this study, I am much more confident in my abilities as a teacher to adjust to a variety of circumstances and utilize my creativity in my everyday life as an educator.","I intended to see that immersion through Dungeons and Dragons, the students would be more attuned to working as a team and highlighting the strengths of their peers. They were not as open and clear communicating with me as they were when talking with each other.",0
